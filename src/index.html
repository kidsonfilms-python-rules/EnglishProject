            <h1 class="fade">The medieval Christendom was a major part of human history. Christianity is the most
                popular religion
                with Islam and Hinduism following. You have to start the history of Christendom with Jesus of Nazareth.
                Jesus lived in Nazareth in Galilee or the region just north of Judea. Jesus traveled around Judea to
                help spread his message of Christianity. In the same period, Jewish Fortress, Masada, on a mountain top
                in Israel, and held off Romans for two years. Romans eventually overthrew it. Jesus also created many
                teachings and created a new way of living for many many people around him. Christens walked on roads
                speaking greek or Latin spreading Christianity. Empire Constantine converted to Christianity and made
                the Roman Empire into an all-new Christen Empire.</h1>

                style="width:100vw; height: 100vh; filter: brightness(50%)">

            <h1 class="fade"> Christen churches used a hierarchy of power systems when organizing their churches. They
                then made from
                the 4 gospels the New Testament which is sort of a Version 2.0.0 from the Old Testament which was from
                the Jewish. They finally then made a leader of all the churches, the Pope. Christianity did then split
                into two churches, The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Before the split,
                Christianity was booming, not just growing. It was spread all over the world and it was getting closer
                to more people than ever before. After this split, Christianity did grow but, not as one unit but as two
                divisions that rarely communicated between each other. But not even the split caused Christianity to
                contract, it was still growing.</h1>

                style="width:100vw; height: 100vh; filter: brightness(50%)">

            <h1 class="fade">Most people were looking for peace so they turned to Christianity which was thought of as
                help for them.
                Germanic tribes then invaded Britain and then made it into Angland (aka England). Devout Christens in
                Eastern Roman Empire formed religious communities called monasteries. The women in these were called
                nuns. They made the Basilian Rule which stated a lot of rules for monks including that monks had to let
                in
                outsiders. Monks and nuns ran schools and hospitals for the sick. In the end, Christianity is still
                growing and all these facts and factors above are causing it, even today. (Spielvogal 26-47)
